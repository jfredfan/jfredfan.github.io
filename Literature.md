#### Autumn treat
Garrrrrgh~~~ my tongue met the philosopher.

Deep thought you thought in that encounter?

Only million microorganisms squirming on his head,

delightfully I swallowed them altogether.

Not worth it, not worth it!

A puny brainy two-winged creature,

Yuck!

P.S. my first English poem inspired from reading the Vogon's work in [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy).
